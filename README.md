# BrainStation Machine Learning Project

This is a repository prepared for my ML course, which consists of the following:

  1. Jupyter Notebook including codes (in progress, 50% done)
  2. A data folder consists of two datasheets for the project - True and Fake News
  3. A PowerPoint file with slides I prepared for my presentation (in progress)

Due to large data set that leads to computationally heavy, only 50% data will be used in the analysis and modelling
